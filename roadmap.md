# Roadmap

### "Creator is a platform"

We are aiming for a future where users can handle NFTs without depending on platforms.\


Our roadmap for the coming months includes the following new advanced features:

* Enhancement of NFT-related functions
  * NFT Portfolio
  * NFT Market Aggregator
  * NFT Marketplace
* Increase the number of supported chains such as Layer 2.
* Provide SDKs and other tools to help users create their own marketplaces.
* Integrate decentralized storage service e.g. Filecoin or Arweave so that metadata can last longer.
* Develop applications that enable NFT holders to create their limited content.
* Integrate DID and VC systems to make NFT more useful and verifiable in the real world.
